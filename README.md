## Pangram 

This is a simple interactive program using the pgzrun library, which checks whether a string entered by the user is a pangram (a sentence containing every letter of the alphabet at least once). The program allows the user to input a string, checks if it's a pangram when they hit "Enter", and provides feedback. The user can also delete characters using the backspace key.
